# 🧬 Pokémon Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores a cleaned dataset of Pokémon to uncover insights using visualizations. The analysis includes trends across generations, type distributions, base stats, and legendary status.

---

## 📦 Dataset
The dataset used is a cleaned version of the original Pokémon CSV:
- `cleaned_data_pokemon.csv`

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The following key questions were explored using visual analysis:

1. **How many Pokémon have a secondary type?**
2. **What are the most common Pokémon types overall (primary + secondary)?**
3. **How are legendary and non-legendary Pokémon distributed across generations?**
4. **How do legendary Pokémon differ in stats like Attack vs. Defense?**
5. **What is the distribution of total base stats?**
6. **How do Attack, Defense, and Speed vary across generations?**
7. **Does Special Attack show a multimodal distribution?**
8. **How do HP and Speed vary across different primary types?**
